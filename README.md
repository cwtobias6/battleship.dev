# battleship.dev
A vanilla JavaScript Web-App with MVC design

This is a web-based clone of the classic battleship game. 
The player must guess where the computer's 3 battleships are located on the map in as few guesses as possible.
To help with the design of the code, I chose a Model View Controller design. 

Created Using: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Twitter Bootstrap
